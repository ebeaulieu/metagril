<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong><a id="EN"></a>Guide for Completing metaGRIL Data Submission Form</strong></h2>
    <br />
    <p>This guide provides information on how to complete the metaGRIL data submission form. There are six sections to the form, and some fields are required (denoted by a red asterisk *), while others are optional.</p>
    <p>Information on individual fields and examples for their content are provided below.</p>
    <p>A dataset is here defined as a coherent collection of data characterized by both temporal and spatial coverage.</p>
    <p>The main objectives of this metadata form are to increase the discoverability of a dataset and to facilitate its reuse. As you fill in this form, be sure to give enough information so your dataset can be found and reused using keywords from your research
        area.</p>
    
<h4><strong>Data File Upload<a id="upload"></a></strong></h4>
    <p>A metadata form is usually accompanied by a dataset. However, GRIL has decided to let their members choose the most appropriate online data repository and the level of access (including private). Please refer to the <a href="https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site=5451&amp;owa_no_fiche=63"
        target="_blank">GRIL Policy on Data Archiving and Sharing (GPDAS)</a> for more information on data archiving and to access the list of suggested data repository.</p>
    <p>Once you have uploaded your private or public dataset to a repository, insert the corresponding DOI (or the identifier of your record in a recognized database) in the field "Alternate Identifier" of the metaGRIL form instead of uploading your dataset
        file on our server.</p>
    <p>If on the other hand, it is useful for your colleagues to have more information in the metaGRIL about the fields in your online dataset stored elsewhere, you must proceed with some extra steps. Because additional information on variables cannot be
        added without first uploading a file in the software behind metaGRIL, please follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To get around having to upload your data itself, you should instead load an empty .csv file, using the same name as that used for the file deposited in the chosen data repository.</li>
        <li>Once the dummy file is loaded, click "Describe".</li>
        <li>Proceed to add the information requested regarding other variables in your dataset by providing names, attributes, definitions, and units for each variable type.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h4><strong>Overview<a id="overview"></a></strong></h4>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>* Title</strong></span>:
        <a id="title"></a>A descriptive title of the dataset. The title should provide enough information for someone casually scanning a list of dataset titles to know whether the data are relevant to them. This implies that the data context should be indicated in
        the title without making the title too long. In general, the title should indicate what kind of data were collected and the spatial, taxonomic, and temporal extents the dataset covers.</p>
    <p><em>Examples of descriptive titles:</em>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Boreal Qu√©bec Lake Zooplankton Data from 1972 to 1988.</li>
        <li>Tassajara Hot Springs Reserve Water Chemistry Data from 1990 to 2000.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Examples of incomplete titles:</em>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Zooplankton Data</li>
        <li>Water Chemistry Data</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>* Abstract</strong></span>:
        <a id="abstract"></a>Short (maximum of 350 words) summary of the purpose and content of the dataset. Entering a dataset abstract is required.</p>
    <p><em>Example:</em> Data were collected every year in summer and fall from 1967 to 1979. Sampling was conducted only in the fall from 1980 to 1988. For each specimen taken, data were recorded on species, date, location, time, sex, and body measurements
        including total length, length of tailspine, presence/absence of eggs . The purpose of the data was to index the population size of all species present over a long time period. If applicable, insert the citation of the publication (including the
        publication DOI) related to the dataset, at the end of the Abstract field.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords</strong>:
        <a id="keywords"></a>Provide information for as many keywords as needed. The information is provided in groups of two fields: keyword and keyword thesaurus. Repeat steps 1-2 below for each additional keyword.</p>
    <p>Have a look at the NASA Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) (particularly under EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere) and see if you can find keywords that appropriately describe your dataset. If not, use your own keywords.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Keyword: Enter a word or phrase that describes your dataset.</li>
        <li>Keyword Thesaurus: Select whether you used the <a href="https://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/learn/keywords.html" target="_blank">NASA Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)</a> or not to choose your keywords.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To edit a keyword entry, click on the keyword entered, change the keyword and/or keyword thesaurus, and click on the area just right of the thesaurus drop-down menu (the text field and the drop-down menus will disappear). To delete an entry, click
        on the "X".</p>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>* Funding</strong></span>:
        <a id="funding"></a>Add the award number from the funding agency. If your project is not associated with any funding agency number, insert a distinctive name that could easily identify the project funding sources.</p>
    <p><strong>Publication Date</strong>:
        <a id="pub_date"></a>Set a citation date for this dataset if desired. This will be the date used by others who might want to cite your dataset in the future. This can be a year (YYYY) or an exact date (YYYY-MM-DD).</p>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>* Usage Rights</strong></span>:
        <a id="usage_rights"></a>Change the usage rights for your metadata to public domain to correspond with the open access rights that apply to the entire metaGRIL. Note that this same level of usage DOES NOT apply to your dataset itself.</p>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>* Alternate Identifier</strong></span>:
        <a id="alt_id"></a>If available, please provide other pertinent information that can identify and locate the dataset within your site's data management system. For example, provide the DOI of the dataset or the identifier of a recognized database where your
        dataset has been integrated.</p>
    
<h4><strong>People<a id="people"></a></strong></h4>
    <p>Add one or more people, organizations, or position names associated with the dataset. Students or postdocs filling out the metaGRIL form should check with their main advisor before filling out this section.</p>
    <p>At least one entry with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Creator role is required, and creators will be listed in the dataset citation</span>, i.e. the person responsible for developing the dataset. Other roles include, for example, the
        principal investigator in a collaborative project, the first author of the main publication using the dataset, etc. The organization name, e-mail, website link, phone, fax, and address information are optional.</p>
    <p>This section is divided in three parts:</p>

<h4><strong>Locations<a id="locations"></a></strong></h4>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>* Description</strong></span>:
        <a id="description_en"></a>Enter a general description of the geographic area in which the data were collected. This can be a simple place name (e.g., Laurentides, QC) or a fuller description. This field supplements the coordinates provided here and helps orient the
        data user about the general location of the study.</p>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>* Bounding Box Coordinates</strong></span>:
        <a id="coordinates"></a>The latitude and longitude coordinates (in decimals) of the location where the data were collected. At least one lat/long pair is required. <strong>If you enter one coordinate pair only</strong>: This indicates a point location. <strong>If you enter both coordinate pairs</strong>:
        This indicates a bounding box. The first coordinate pair is the northwest corner and the second coordinate pair is the southeast corner of the bounding box.</p>
    <p>If your data are already described by geographic coordinates, minimum and maximum of longitude and latitude fields can be calculated and entered as described in the table below. If not, you can build a custom bounding box with a tool like <a href="http://www.automatingosint.com/blog/geographic-bounding-box-drawing-tool/"
        target="_blank">Bounding Box Drawing Tool</a>. Enter the location which you want the bounding box to cover or simply use the hand tool in the map box to move to the right region on the map and then use the rectangle tool to draw the geographic
        limits of your data
        <br />sampling. The coordinates will be shown below the map box. Northwest coordinates correspond to maximum latitude and minimum longitude, and southeast coordinates to minimum latitude and maximum longitude.</p>
    
<h4><strong>Taxa<a id="taxa_en"></a></strong></h4>
    <p><strong>General Taxonomic Coverage</strong>: How you identified the range of taxa addressed in this dataset.</p>
    <p>Provide a list of the taxa that are associated with this dataset. This includes taxa for which the dataset contains measurements, and taxa for which the data have relevance in less direct ways. In general, if a data user searching for a particular
        taxonomic name should find this dataset, then the taxon should be included in this list.</p>
    <p>Please check the <a href="http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/MyToL/www/index.php" target="_blank">Glasgow Taxonomic Name Server</a> or the <a href="http://www.itis.usda.gov/" target="_blank">Integrated Taxonomic Information System</a> for correct
        spelling of taxonomic names.</p>
    <p>For each taxon, follow the two steps below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Taxonomic Rank</strong>: Enter the level in the taxonomic hierarchy (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, or Species).</li>
        <li><strong>Taxonomic Name</strong>: Enter the scientific name for the level entered under Taxonomic Rank (e.g. <em>Animalia</em>, <em>Chordata</em>, <em>Mammalia</em>, <em>Carnivoria</em>, <em>Ursidae</em>, <em>Ursus</em>, or <em>Ursus arctos</em>).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To edit an entry, click on the taxonomic information entered, change the taxonomic rank and/or name, and click on the area just right of the text field for the name (the two text fields will disappear). To delete an entry, click on the "X".</p>
    
<h4><strong>Methods</strong></h4>
    <p><strong>Methods</strong>:
        <a id="methods"></a>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step</strong>: Description of the procedure used to produce the data. This is intended to be a general method description that is suitable to help potential users of the data decide if the data are appropriate for their purposes. A new text
        block is added after each text block is filled.</p>
    <p><strong>Sampling</strong>:
        <a id="sampling"></a>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Study Extent</strong>: Describe the temporal, spatial and taxonomic extent of the study, supplementing the information on coverage provided above. For example, if the temporal coverage of the data is 1990-2000, you might provide details about
        any years that were missed or the months in which sampling actually occurred. </p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: Describe the sampling design of the study. For example, you might describe the way in which treatments were assigned to sampling units. </p>
